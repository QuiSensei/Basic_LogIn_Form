# Login & Registration Form Project  

Hello everyone, QuiSensei here 👋  

This is a small project I made for my subject **IT 101**.  

---

## 📌 About the Project  
This repository contains two simple HTML form pages:  
- `login_form.html`  
- `registration_form.html`  

Both forms share the same basic structure, but the registration form has additional input fields.

## 🎨 CSS (Styling)  
Now for the interesting part—the CSS!  

You might notice that the stylesheet looks a little different from the usual `.css` structure. That’s because I used **CSS Nesting**.  

I first discovered this in 2024 from a YouTube video, but the trend actually started around 2023. At that time, only about **84.92% of browsers supported it** (see [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/css-nesting) for the latest info).  

Some developers discourage using nesting CSS because of readability concerns, but personally, I enjoyed experimenting with it. I think it makes my code **cleaner and more organized**—definitely worth trying! 😁

## ⚡ JavaScript  
The project also includes a small JavaScript file.  

I’ll be honest—I’m still learning JavaScript, so I got some help from ChatGPT for this part. It was a good learning experience for me!

## 🙌 Closing  
That’s it! I hope this repository helps you with your own projects.  

Thanks for checking it out, and **good luck on your coding journey! 🚀**
