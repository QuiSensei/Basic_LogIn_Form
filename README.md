Hello everyone QuiSensei here, I will explain you about this small form that I made.

This a small project of mine for my subject IT 101.

Bisically both login_form.html and registration_form.html uses the same structure, the only difference between them is the registration_form.html have added input in the form. 

Now into the interesting part of this project that I personaly engjoyed doing, notice that the style sheet (CSS) might be a little different to what you used to in .css but trust me it's
wort to try, the structure of this .css uses the so called nesting CSS I think this is a recent trend back in 2023 or something, because the first time I saw nesting css is in 2024
